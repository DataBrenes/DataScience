# Network Science
Network science is a very important discipline within data science, because so many of the data sets that interest us can be characterized as networks. The list is endless, but here are a few prominent examples:
* Friend networks on Facebook
* Professional networks on LinkedIn
* Follower networks on Twitter

This area of my repo displays my explorations of network science in the eponymous course at Indiana University. Our professor for spring 2018, Y.Y. Ahn, is a wonderful instructor and mentor.
