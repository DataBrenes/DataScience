# The Strength of Weak Ties

## Summary of Granovetter's Argument

Prior to [Mark Granovetter's groundbreaking 1973 paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392), sociologists had focused their research on the features and advantages of strongly clustered local ties--family, close neighbors, close friends. Granovetter had the moxie to ask if there might be a situation where "weak" ties were more favorable than strong ties, and the gumption to find the data to investigate the question.

Having investigated the relationships that led to hiring decisions in Boston, Granovetter's main argument is that strong ties lead to dense but relatively isolated clusters of relationships. Relying exclusively on strong ties therefore sharply restricts a job seeker's information and access to employment opportunities. Thus successful job hunts typically rely on weak ties across social bridges, yielding much broader information and contacts.  

I agree with this argument because it is supported by Granovetter's 1973 study of Boston job hires. In addition, my own experience confirms the result; the majority of my successful job searches have been strongly aided by weak ties.  

Another reason that weak ties are important is that a job seeker's strong ties do not necessarily have access to the right information and contacts. For example, a recent college graduate seeking employment in finance may not have relatives or close friends who work in finance. On the other hand, the recent graduate will likely find that exploiting weak ties like young alumni from the same college will lead to the right information and contacts to find the desired job.  

Granovetter also claimed that weak ties facilitate social activism. He hypothesized that a community characterized by cliques of strong ties with few weak ties to act as bridges are unlikely to unite on behalf of a cause, whereas communities with many weak ties are more likely to succeed. Granovetter cited two examples of neighborhood efforts to oppose Boston town government, one unsuccessful and one successful, in support of his argument. However, his analysis of the two examples (West End and Charlestown neighborhoods) was somewhat speculative.  

## Support from other studies  

Numerous studies have confirmed Granovetter's argument with respect to job seeking:

*   [Montgomery (1994) reported](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/230410) that weak ties led to broader access to information and resources, resulting in higher employment and higher wages.
*   [Spalter-Roth et al. reported](http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/documents/research/pdfs/Bach_Beyond5_Social_Capital.pdf) that 2012 sociology graduates had far better odds of landing a career position by using weak ties (faculty, former jobs or supervisors) rather than strong ties (family/close friend) or no ties (employment agency, online job search).

Other studies have shown that weak ties facilitate diffusion across networks:

*   [Baller and Richardson (2009)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002214650905000302) reported that suicidal ideation spreads between American teenagers primarily along weak ties.
*   [Todo, Matous, and Inouye (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316301056) reported that weak ties led to greater diffusion of innovation and productivity gains than strong ties among Japanese businesses.
*   [Lawrence (2007)](http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/7339/2/download%3Fid%3D17428%26filename%3Dthe-strength-of-weak-school-ties-full-report.pdf) reported that weak ties helped spread innovations and best practices between English schools.
*   [VanderWaal, et al. (2016](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/27/4/1190/1744834)) reported that weak ties in giraffe social networks led to a more rapid spread of gastrointestinal helmith parasites.

Studies have shown weak ties to be important in many surprising fields:

*   **Information retrieval/search** - According to [Ke and Mostafa (2009)](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-480/paper6.pdf), information that is too strongly clustered dramatically degraded search efficiency in large networks. A threshold level of weak ties across information clusters has to be maintained to facilitate efficient search.
*   **Artistic creativity** - [Baer (2010)](http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/workingpapers/pdf/2010-02-008.pdf) reported that actor creativity was highest in networks where weak ties connected actors to a variety of practices and innovations.
*   **Scientific creativity** - [Perry-Smith's 2009 study](http://amj.aom.org/content/49/1/85.short) of scientist social networks showed that weak ties are beneficial for scientific creativity.

## Weak ties in the digital age

Twitter and Facebook demonstrate the importance of weak ties every day. The Arab Spring, #OccupyWallStreet, #BlackLivesMatter, and #MeToo movements would have been impossible without the ability to exploit weak ties across social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Granovetter's hypothesis about the importance of weak ties in social action was not necessarily supported by the data in 1973, but the data today are indisputable.
