## Computer Vision
Self-driving cars...automated cancer detection from MRIs...face recognition. So much of the great AI leap forward has occurred in the field of computer vision. I never cease to marvel that a network of tensors and mathematical convolutions, trained by gradient descent, can sometimes see as well as a human adult.

In this section of my code portfolio you will find my explorations in the field of computer vision.

+ [Orientation](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/blob/master/AI/CompVision/Orientation/README.md) - I hand-crafted a feed-forward neural network to build a prediction model for the orientation of 8 x 8 micro-thumbnail images. It was a terrific learning experience and should be quite instructional for you readers. I would rather use Tensorflow or Keras on future projects, though!
