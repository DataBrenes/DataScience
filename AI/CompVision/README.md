## Computer Vision
Self-driving cars...automated cancer detection from MRIs...face recognition. So much of the great AI leap forward has occurred in the field of computer vision. I never cease to marvel that a network of tensors and mathematical convolutions, trained by gradient descent, can sometimes see as well as a human adult.

In this section of my code portfolio you will find my explorations in the field of computer vision.
