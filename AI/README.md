Artificial intelligence is the hottest of the hot new buzzwords, but for a very good reason--it is yielding remarkable advances in a variety of fields. Consigned to the dustbin of computer science in the 1990s, it re-emerged in about 2012 with a vengeance when a combination of new hardware, new methods, and massive datasets yielded fantastic results. Artificial intelligence can now identify the digits in a zip code or the faces in a picture more reliably than humans. 

If you really want to succeed in the field, however, you must understand its foundations. Professor David Crandall brought out the best in all of us grad students in his Fall 2017 course on the Elements of Artificial Intelligence. In this section of my portfolio, I publish some of the most useful things I learned and most useful sample code I wrote.
