# Natural Language Processing
Much of the approximately 30 zettabytes of data in the world are unstructured or semi-structured documents, which may be in text or audio format (web pages, emails, voice recordings, Facebook posts, podcasts, tweets, and so forth). Natural language processing (NLP) is the interaction of machine learning with these data. Traditional topics in NLP include document search, automated translation, voice recognition, text classification, and text-to-speech; in 2018, the cutting edge of NLP includes chatbots and a Google assistant [that can schedule a haircut or make a restaurant reservation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ9MBYfu_0A). 

This section of my repo contains my explorations and insights in NLP.
