Python is an excellent all-purpose language that can be used for scripting, web apps (Django), data analytics, and big data processing. It has libraries for Hadoop Map-Reduce, Apache Spark, neural net programming (TensorFlow, Keras), data modeling/processing (numpy, scikit-learn), Amazon Glue (ETL as a service), and stuff too numerous to mention here. Here are some Python topics I have explored:

* [Tail Recursion](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/blob/master/Python/Tail-Recursion.MD)
* [Python as a Functionally Oriented Language](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/blob/master/Python/FunctionalOrientation.MD)
* [Introduction to Python Unit Tests](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/tree/master/Python/IntroToUnitTest)
