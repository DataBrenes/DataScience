Python is an excellent all-purpose language that can be used for scripting, web apps (Django), data analytics, and big data processing. It has libraries for Hadoop Map-Reduce, Apache Spark, neural net programming (TensorFlow, Keras), data modeling/processing (numpy, scikit-learn), Amazon Glue (ETL as a service), and stuff too numerous to mention here. Here are some Python topics I have explored:

* [Tail Recursion](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/blob/master/Python/Tail-Recursion.MD)
* [Python as a Functionally Oriented Language](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/blob/master/Python/FunctionalOrientation.MD)
* [Introduction to Python Unit Tests](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/tree/master/Python/IntroToUnitTest)
* [Numpy for the Win!](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/blob/master/Python/WhyNumpy-Optimization.MD) - A simple test script shows why numpy can speed up machine learning calculations by orders of magnitude. Also included: a simple example of functional programming.
* [Model Selection with scikit-learn](https://github.com/chrisfalter/DataScience/blob/master/NLP/Battle_of_Tweet_Classification_Algorithms.ipynb) - This experiment uses scikit-learn's model selection features to compare the following algorithms for tweet geolocation classification:
  + Naive Bayes
  + Adaboost
  + Random Forest
  + K-Nearest Neighbors
  + Gradient Boost
  + Model Stack of Best 3 Models
  
  It also shows how to use `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` and `sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer` to create a custom data preprocessing pipeline, and how to use `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` to tune model hyperparameters.
